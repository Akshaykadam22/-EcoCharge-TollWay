# -EcoCharge-TollWay
 "EcoCharge TollWay utilizes piezoelectric crystals at toll plazas to convert vehicle pressure into electricity, providing a green energy solution for emergency power supply."

## Overview
This project explores the development of a piezoelectric power generator aimed at harnessing energy from vehicles stopping at toll plazas. Utilizing piezoelectric crystals placed beneath the road surface at toll gates, this system captures and converts mechanical pressure exerted by vehicles into electrical energy. This energy is then stored in a battery, serving as an emergency power supply for toll plaza operations.

## Introduction
The piezoelectric effect allows certain materials to generate an electric charge in response to mechanical stress. This project leverages this effect by implementing piezoelectric crystals in a practical, real-world scenario: capturing energy from vehicles at toll plazas, which otherwise would be lost as heat and vibration.

## Components
The key components used in this project include:
- **Piezoelectric Crystals (6 units)**: Convert mechanical stress into electrical energy.
- **3V Rechargeable Battery**: Stores the harvested energy.
- **Resistor & Potentiometer**: Manage the flow of electricity and adjust output.
- **Capacitor**: Stabilizes the electrical output and stores energy.
- **LED**: Acts as an indicator for energy harvesting and storage.
- **Diode**: Prevents backflow of current, ensuring energy is stored efficiently.
- **Proteus Software**: Used for creating and testing the electronic circuit model.

## Setup and Installation
### Prerequisites
- Understanding of basic electronics and circuit design.
- Proteus software for circuit simulation and testing.

### Building the Generator
1. **Circuit Design**: Start by designing the circuit in Proteus, incorporating all the components mentioned. Ensure the piezoelectric elements are correctly connected to the charging circuit.
2. **Physical Assembly**: Construct the physical model based on the Proteus design. Place the piezoelectric crystals beneath a simulated road surface at the toll gate model.
3. **Integration**: Connect the piezoelectric setup to the battery through the designed circuit, ensuring the energy harvested is stored effectively.

## Usage
This system is intended for implementation at toll plazas, where vehicles stopping to pay tolls exert mechanical pressure on the road surface equipped with piezoelectric crystals. The generated electrical energy is stored in a battery, ready for use as an emergency power supply for the toll plaza's operations.

## Testing and Results
During our testing phase, we focused on evaluating the efficiency of the EcoCharge TollWay system in converting mechanical pressure into electrical energy under real-world conditions at toll plazas. Despite the system not generating large quantities of power, our results confirmed its effectiveness in powering small appliances essential to toll plaza operations, such as lighting and electronic display boards.

### Key Findings:
- **Energy Efficiency**: The system demonstrated a remarkable ability to harness and convert energy from vehicle pressure efficiently.
- **Application Potential**: Even with its modest energy output, EcoCharge TollWay proved capable of supporting the power needs of small-scale electronics, contributing to the toll plaza's energy sustainability.
- **Future Improvements**: Based on the testing outcomes, future enhancements will focus on optimizing the piezoelectric material placement and circuit efficiency to maximize energy harvest.

This testing phase underscores EcoCharge TollWay's potential as a sustainable and efficient solution for powering essential small appliances in toll plazas, marking a step forward in green energy utilization in infrastructure.
